# Angular16 Motoko

Welcome to the Angular16 Motoko Github repo! 
This repository is made to be a plug-and-play solution for using Angular16 as an ICP smart contract canister front-end with Motoko as the canister back-end. 

## Quickstart
run git clone 'https://github.com/JupiterM/Angular16Motoko'.
cd Angular16Motoko.
run 'npm install -y'. 
run 'npm run deploy:local'.

ZoneAware promise returns value in console. Only there to demostrate connectivity. Will be changed later.

## Deploy on IC Network
Just change values in 'canister_ids.json' to your own.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
